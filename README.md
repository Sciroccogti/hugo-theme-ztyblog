You can download the theme manually by going to [https://github.com/zhengzangw/hugo-theme-ztyblog](https://github.com/zhengzangw/hugo-theme-ztyblog) and pasting it to `themes/ztyblog` in your root directory.

You can also clone it directly to your Hugo folder:

```bash

If you don't want to make any radical changes, it's the best option, because you can get new updates when they are available. To do so, include it as a git submodule:

## How to configure

The theme doesn't require any advanced configuration. You can refer to the file `config.toml.example`.

If you choose CDN for third-part function, which is recommended, you only need to set `useCDN=true` in your setting. Otherwise, you have to run `npm install` and use `./load` to add dependency.

To auto generate information of git commit, add following line to your `deploy.sh`

```bash
gsed -i "/localcommithash/c \\\tlocalcommithash = \"$(git rev-parse HEAD)\"" config.toml
gsed -i "/localcommitdate/c \\\tlocalcommitdate = \"$(git log --pretty=format:"%cd" $(git rev-parse HEAD) -1)\"" config.toml
gsed -i "/localcommitcomment/c \\\tlocalcommitcomment = \"$(git log --pretty=format:"%s" $(git rev-parse HEAD) -1)\"" config.toml
cd public
gsed -i "/binarycommitdate/c \\\tbinarycommitdate = \"$(git log --pretty=format:"%cd" $(git rev-parse HEAD) -1)\"" ../config.toml
cd ..
```
